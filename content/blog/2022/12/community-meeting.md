Community meetings have been a recurring demand from different sides and with the new year approaching,
it's time to make our first good resolution.

To improve community feedback, the Kubewarden project has decided to organize a monthly community meeting.
The first community meeting to be held is scheduled for January 12th, 2023 at 4 PM UTC.

On top of the GitHub Discussion, GitHub issues, and the Kubewarden channel on the CNCF Slack channel, the community meeting is an additional opportunity to meet and discuss Kubewarden and shape its future together.
