If you use the deprecated Kubernetes PodSecurityPolicy (a.k.a PSP), you should
wonder what to do after the Kubernetes v1.25 version. When the PSP will be removed.
If this in mind, the Kuberwarden team wrote a [documentation](https://docs.kubewarden.io/psp-migration.html)
to help users migrate away from PSPs to Kuberwarden policies.

Check it out and let us know if you have question about this!
