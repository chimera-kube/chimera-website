The Kubewarden project has recently improved how it shares information and
involves others by starting a new
[community](https://github.com/kubewarden/community) repository. This move was
made after a suggestion from the CNCF during their last yearly review. The aim
is to bring together all the documentation in one place and make it easier for
both new and current contributors to get involved.

This new repository is a place for finding out about the project's rules,
security measures, project components, and what's happening in each Kubewarden
GitHub organization repository. 

By putting all this important information in one place, Kubewarden is making it
simpler for people to join and contribute to the project. This effort not only
makes joining the project easier for newcomers but also improves how the
project is run. The community repository is meant to be a go-to resource for
anyone interested in the Kubewarden project, whether they're just getting
started or want to contribute more.
