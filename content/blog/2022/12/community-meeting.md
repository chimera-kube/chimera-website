Community meetings have been a recurring demand from different sides and with the new year approaching,
it's time to make our first good resolution.

To improve community feedback, the Kubewarden project has decided to organize a monthly community meeting.
The first community meeting to be held is scheduled for January 12th, 2023 at 4 PM UTC.

In addition to [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/kubewarden/discussions), [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller/issues/new/choose), and the **#kubewarden** channel on the [Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/signup), the community meeting is an additional avenue for the community to discuss Kubewarden and shape its future together.

Feel free to join us
